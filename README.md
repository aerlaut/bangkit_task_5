# AirBNB price prediction
We made a model to predict AirBNB price in 7 cities in the US based on  features such as
- Property type (Apartment, House, Condominium, etc.)
- The number of people that can be accommmodated
- Number of bedrooms, beds and bathrooms
- Cancellation policy
- City (Boston, Chicago, DC, LA, SF, NYC)
- Room type (Private room, shared room, entire home/apartment)

We used the publicly available data at Kaggle :

Data is also uploaded in available in this repo, with some columns truncated.

We worked collaboratively together using Google Collab. The model can be seen on this Collab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SKaR_JIhz50oj1smiM5VOuQaoTqnhHAU
